Figure~\ref{fig:posterior_pvalues} presents a visualization of the period boundaries for all $5$ sessions. The x-axis corresponds to time and the y-axis presents the algorithm that was used to generate the boundaries. The vertical yellow lines indicate the inferred period boundaries; a period exists between two yellow boundaries. The periods are labeled sequentially for refernece in this discussion. Finally, the color of the period indicates the posterior probability that a human validator will select the algorithmically generated description for that period. Light blue corresponds to a low probability of the algorithmic description being correctly chosen and bark blue or black corresponds to a high probability.

In general we note that the Algorithm 1 periods are darker than the periods of Uniform8; the Uniform8 periods are darker than the periods for Uniform5. We also note that when the period boundaries line up entirely (between different algorithms), the period colors tend to be very similar (refer to \textit{Session 1, Algorithm 1, period 12} and \textit{Session 1, Uniform8, period 8} for one such example). The file difficuly variability is seen with Session 3 being the darkest (easiest) and Sessions 4 and 5 being the lightest on average (most difficult to select the algorithm's period description).

It is interesting to investigate some specific aspects of this plot. Starting with Session 1, Algorithm~1 has a slightly darker period 1 than the other algotihms. Uniform8 and Algorithm~1 both present the description that ``Water is mostly flowing to the Wetlands, Jungle and Plains''. Uniform5 describes the longer period as water mostly flowing to the ``Jungle, Wetlands and Plains'' and so these are all similar in nature. The dummy choices are reasonable in all three cases with one example being: ``Water is mostly flowing to the Plains, Jungle and Wetlands''. At time $t=44s$, the end boundary for Algorithm~1, period~1, the students position the logs to direct a substantial amount of water to the Jungle and to the Plains. Algorithm~1 correctly detected this change and defined a new period 2. In the other algorithms, as period 1 was extended into this dominant Jungle/Plains dynamic, the descriptions became more difficult to choose from (hence the lowest probability for a successful choice in Uniform5).

Session 4 presents an interesting scenario for Algorithm 1, periods 3 and 4 and Uniform8, period 4. Uniform8, period4 roughly spans the full length of periods 3 and 4 in Algorithm 1. However, periods 3 and 4, Algorithm 1 break this longer session into 2. Independent validators correctly selected the Algorithm 1 description $\frac{4}{4}$ and $\frac{2}{2}$ times yet the Uniform8, period 4 description was only selected correctly $\frac{2}{6}$ times. This suggests that the algorithm was able to find a break in this period that helped to improve its interpretability.

Session 5, Algorithm 1, shows periods has light periods $7$ and $9$ interspersed by darker periods. For both of these periods, the Algorithm 1 description is misleading. The ordering of the parameters conveys a very hierarchical structure to the message that is being conveyed. This is not always correct. In both of these cases, the parameters were actually similar in magnitude and thus the strict ordering of the description may have been misleading. In Section~\ref{sec:class-assistive}, we discuss how future work will entail correctly compiling the available information to design an assistive aid for teachers. Making decision regarding how the data are presented will certainly from an important aspect of this work.

A final point that can be made from this session is that the rain events of the system are not identified well by the algorithm and can also lead to misleading descriptions that are generated. It remains a challenge to find a robust way for dealing with rain events. The simplest suggestion is to add these events to the log files that are stored as part of the output from CW.





\chapter{Plant and Animal Relations}\label{cha:appendix2}
For completeness, we have included a map to highlight the relationshps between the plants and animals in Connected Worlds. Students plant trees and observe the arrival of animals that use the trees to support their habitat. Mimicking a real-world scenario, the fauna for a biome depends on the flora, and the flora are unique for a specific biome. In other words, each biome can support different plants and each type of plant attracts a certain type of animal. Larger and higher level plants require the presence of smaller and lower level plants. Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview_plant_animal} presents a schematic that displays the plant-animal relations of Connected Worlds.

The blue boxes correspond to areas of the simulation that do support animals but do not have plants that grow there. The fauna-flora specific relations can clearly be seen by the arrows that link the plants (green ovals) and animals (red ovals). The plants and animals are endemic to their biome.}
